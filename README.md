# nexus-fl-risk-prediction
This repository implements a simulated Federated Learning (FL) pipeline aligned with the Nexus Observatory Protocol (OP). It enables decentralized AI training on environmental data for flood and heatwave prediction, while integrating secure compute practices and mock zero-knowledge proofs to ensure verifiability.
